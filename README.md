- 👋 Hi, I’m @SpoofyMe
- 👀 I’m interested in data science. Now, that's very general... and from my point of view, it should stay that way.
  It's a broad field, where knowledge across multiple fields can be very useful. Granted, I won't be able to know much about everything - but let's see how far I'll get ;)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - Deep Learning (Keras, PyTorch, Tensorflow)
  - Containers (Docker, Kubernetes)
  - MLOps
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing in particular - let me know if you have an interesting project!
